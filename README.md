# SEO Toolbox

SEO toolbox is a curated of the Best SEO Resources chosen by myself throughout my successful career as an SEO consultant. It contains tons of tools, extensions, guides, content, apps and more to help you learn SEO.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install packages required to build this project.

```bash
npm install
```

## Motivation

They say you should write about things you know. Well, I know SEO and I'm learning to code so, I built a small SEO resource database in React to flex my skills and learn. In particular I wanted to better understand useState and useEffect in combination with ternary expressions to filter buttons which update the DOM.

## Features

The database is an array of local objects for both the resources and the categories. I have also experimented with [framer motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) to add some subtle animation to the app.

## Credit

Thank you [dz-levelZero](https://github.com/Dz-LevelZero/Filter-Animation) for sharing your code, this really helped me put this together :)

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. Feel free to add more resources into the data file.
